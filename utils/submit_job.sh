Usage: submit_job.sh [-x] [-J jobname] -s script [launch options]
Usage: submit_job.sh [-x] [-J jobname] commands [launch options]

Use either -s script to indicate a file with commands to run,
where different lines should be run in parallel, or specify
commands to run.

-x
    Run remora on the command (only works with one command)
    to monitor resource usage (e.g. memory) periodically.
    Results will be saved in \$BATCHDIR/JobXXX.remora.

-J
    Job name. Information about the job will be saved in
    \$BATCHDIR/\${jobname}XX.{sh,slurm,out}, where XX is a
    serial number. Default is: Job

-s script
    Run commands in \$script. Commands on different lines will
    be run in parallel. If this option is used, it must come
    last before any launch options.

Run launch -h for explanation of other options.

Must define environment variable BATCHDIR. For example:
export BATCHDIR=\$WORK/batch

After submission, running_jobs.sh will show commands for
all jobs.

To look up how you ran a job to run some command before,
run grep -l [command] \$BATCHDIR/*.sh to find the job name.
Then look at \${job}.out for duration, number of nodes, etc.

Examples:
# Submit a job to display hello world:
submit_job.sh 'echo "hello world"' -N 1 -n 1 -r 00:01:00 -p development

# Display hello world twice, executing in parallel on different
# cores of one node:
echo 'echo "hello world 1"' > myscript.sh
echo 'echo "hello world 2"' >> myscript.sh
submit_job.sh -s myscript.sh -N 1 -n 2 -r 00:01:00 -p development
EOF
    exit 1
